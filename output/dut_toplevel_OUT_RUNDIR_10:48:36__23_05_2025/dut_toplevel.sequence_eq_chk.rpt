Boundary outputs mapping
Status:
    Incomplete
Description:
    Some of the design's outputs are not mapped.
    All outputs must be proven equal to complete the SEC proof.
    To get the list of unmapped outputs, use "check_sec -interface -unmapped -signal_type primary_output -imp".

Boundary outputs proof
Status:
    Invalid
Description:
    Counter examples were found for some of the mapped outputs. The SEC proof
    is complete only when all of the outputs are proven equal
    and all related precondition covers are covered.
